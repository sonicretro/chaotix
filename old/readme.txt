A lot has been done since the last time I really touched this, so I don't know everything off the top of my head. That said, please ask me for assistance if you are unsure of something I did. I may update this readme (or possibly some other file) to explain everything over time.

I still do not know how to get a fully rebuildable ROM, nor do I know how the bank switcher handles saving files. What I do know is that a workable disassembly will be touch due to having to watch out for all three components and making sure everything fits in the ROM in a way the 68000 will like (as it is limited by the bank switcher).

Thanks to everyone who helped me up to this point.

Enjoy,
